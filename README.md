# flambes: Automatic asset updater and server for [flambe][flambe].

For fast game development iterations, flambes detect changes in assets, e.g. images, notify the client, and the client will automatically update those assets at runtime.

As a bonus, it will parse change Open Office spreadsheet documents, and push the changed file as JSON to the client.  


## Howto:

This library is at the currently in the experimental stage and is written for Haxe 3.

Instructions coming soon.
